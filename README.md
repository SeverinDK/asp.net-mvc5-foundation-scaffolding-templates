MVC 5 Scaffolding Templates for Zurb Foundation 5 instead of Bootstrap

To use this simply include the folder CodeTemplates in your solution and the scaffolding will use these templates instead of the default ones. It's important to note that these were edited in a hurry, so I cant guarantee that they will work all the time. I will get back to this soon and finish it up so I'm sure it's perfect.
